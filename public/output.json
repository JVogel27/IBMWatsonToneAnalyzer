To protect your company you must protect your data. ICDES advanced data protection provides the best data security, integrity and availability at rest and in transit. Your data is rendered private and tamper resistance, making it impenetrable to brute force attacks.\n\nSimple and Easy to Use\nICDES installs onto your server(s) in minutes. Configurations allow for an admin to identify  which directories and/or files to protect, or they can create a simple secure data store target that can be used to protect entire disk images or root file systems. Works with structured and unstructured data.\n\nHighly Scalable\nICDES does not require an expensive external keystore to house the file encryption keys. The advanced simplified key management system securely handles storage of all the file encryption and splitting keys internally and securely.\n\nAlways On and Available Data\nThe Advanced Secure and Advanced Multi-site editions include built-in fault tolerance using an 'M of N' model. Data is randomly split into N pieces, but only M (M &lt; N) pieces are needed to have access to your data. Thus one or more data storage sites can be lost and since all shares are live, there is no disruption in your business or recovery time.\n\nMulti-Site Disaster Recovery\nICDES Advanced Multi-site adds distinct 'M of N' configurations so data shares can be stored simultaneously in geographically separated data centers for disaster recovery architectures. If one site goes down, you will still have access to your data without any lost time to recall data from a backup or archive as the data is Always On.\n\nHighly Performant\nICDES operates at the kernel level making it significantly faster than encryption programs running at the app level.
